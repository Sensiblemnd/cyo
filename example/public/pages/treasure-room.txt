This is it, you think, as you walk into the vast room.

There are coins and rings, goblets and scepters piled high to the ceiling. Whoever this tomb belonged to was important.

Next to an ancient stone sarcophagus, you see a glittering chest, locked tight.

Despite the fact that you are surrounded my more riches than you could ever want, you are inexorably drawn to the chest.

Everything in your mind tells you to run away, but you can't. Something is calling you - you MUST open the chest.
