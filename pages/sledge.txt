You gleefully hop aboard the ancient, granite sledge.

It slides down a gentle incline in a surprisingly smooth way, granite grooves perfectly holding the feet of the sledge, which seemed to be made of a strange, black mineral, possibly obsidian.

You see a fork coming up ahead. Leaning in either direction will force the sledge down the path you choose.

The path on the right seems to lead upwards. The sledge has tons of of momentum and should have no problem climbing. You see a glimmer of sunlight in that direction.

To your left, the track seems to drop steeply, into pitch blackness.
