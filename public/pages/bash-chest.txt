You raise the hammer above your head, and with a mighty swing, you shatter the chest into many small pieces.

You see no treasure, only a strange, pulley-like contraption. You realize that this was a trap that would surely have been your doom.

This frightful realization snaps you back to your senses. You realize that this tomb must drive men mad - just as the legends tell. 

You rush headlong through a massive stone arch. You reach a narrow shaft with a crude ladder carved into the stone wall. 

Quickly you climb, until finally you emerge from a hidden passage in the jungle.

You don't have any treasure, but you escaped with your life. 

What good is treasure anyways?

YOU ESCAPED
THE END
