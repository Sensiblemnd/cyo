You lean right and the cart slides up a gentle incline before coming to rest in a dark and quiet chamber made of mismatched pieces of sharp edged granite.

You climb a spiral staircase. At the top, you notice several golden necklaces and goblets! A tomb perhaps?

You stuff the treasures into your sack.

After walking a bit further, you squeeze through some collapsed stone pillars and are in the jungle again.

You are gleefully eyeing the treasures in your sack when you hear a faint noise, like a lawn mower in the distance.

"That's crazy," you think. "No one would be mowing a lawn out here."

You realize too late what the noise is - a fearsome and night-black panther which has been patiently trailing you for some time.

You were far too distracted with your loot to notice.

You try to flee from the creature, but you are too weighed down by your treasure. You are never seen again.

THE CURSE CLAIMS ANOTHER
THE END
